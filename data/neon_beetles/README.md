# NEON Beetle Part Masks 🪲

This dataset provides hand-labeled part segmentation annotations for the [2018 NEON Ethanol-preserved Ground Beetles Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/2018-NEON-beetles) (specifically [Revision 7b3731d](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/2018-NEON-beetles/tree/7b3731daca1f91931f8086d6782ab9150ab8ce26)).

It includes 180 carefully labeled images with five part segmentation classes: Head, Pronotum, Elytra, Antenna, and Legs.

## Usage
A sample code for downloading the images and visualizing the masks can be found [here](demo.py).
